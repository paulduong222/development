This file contains the names of the files in the "nonversioned" 
(/isuite-core/src/main/resources/nonversioned) folder and the path where those files 
need to be copied to in a developer's workspace. 

--> Why is this index required? 

This index is required because the destination files are NOT 
part of the version control system. All updates to such files should be made by updating the file in the 
"nonversioned" folder, after which, the development team should be informed about updating their workspace 
with the new or updated file, using THIS index file as a reference.

--> Impact on deployments:

During deployment, the files mentioned below will be copied from the "nonversioned" folder into its respective Destination folder.

index.template.html		|	Flex				|	/html-template
popupblockertester.js	|	Core				|	/Webroot/fx
